# Verilog_codes_synthesised_using_yosys
These are verilog codes that are synthesized using open source tool yosys<br>
Understanding what is synthesis is important. Anyone can produce the synthesized netlist once we give codes. Understanding the entire process of Logic syntheis helps us make less errors, synthesize effectively and also read results in a better manner. 
Logic synthesis consists of various steps - The first one begin RTL synthesis, then logic optimization, then technology mapping and then finally technology mapped optimization. <br>
RTL synthesis is the first step of logic synthesis. In this step the verilog code is converted to netlist consisting of generic logic gates. This is further divided into parsing, elaboration and then finally optimization+translation. This step is important as it tells us how the synthesis tool converts the verilog code to syntax tree (known as parsing) and then this is converted to internal model representation. We should also be aware of what is sythesizable and what is not. <br>
After RTL synthesis, we have logic optimization on generic netlist generated by previous step. This is of two types - 2 level (usually done using Quine's algorithm and aims to find minimal cover) and multilevel logic optimization ( Having idea about directed acyclic graph(boolean logic network) and factored form and various multilevel logic optimization techniques such as eliminate, simplify, extract and substitute help in understanding how the tool optimizes).<br>
Then we have technology mapping where we map the netllist to a standard cell present in the library using proess design kit(PDK). The information of area, delay, power and many such information is present in the library in the form of hierarchy. We should know why the creation of libaries is done and what is the information present in libraries and what are the various modelling schemes used in libaries to model delays, power , etc (NLDM, ECS, CCS, lumped modelling of RC interconnects, distributed modelling of RC and so on). So, in this step we perform technology mapping . <br>
In the final step we do optimization on technology mapped netlist <br>
Having idea about hypercubes, SAT solvers, ROBDD (reduced ordered binary decision diagrams) and much more concepts related to how the tool reads verilog language, uses information from libary, generates netlist and does logic optimization. It also explains how the circuits can be automated to such a great level of abstraction using data structures which model behavior of circuits. 

# 1. FULL ADDER (1 BIT) :
   
   
a. Full adder code -
   
module top(a,b, cin, sum, co) ;<br>
input a,b, cin;<br>
output sum, co;<br>
assign sum=a^b^cin;<br>
assign co=(a&b) | (a&c) | (b&c) ;<br>
endmodule<br>
<br>
<br>


b. Internal model representation - 
This is known as syntax tree. This is the first stage of RTL synthesis known as parsing.

<br>

c. Technlogy mapping - 

I used a 45nm pdk and typical process to do technology mapping. 
I created a yosys script instead of giving individual commands. The script is -<br>
 #read design<br>
read_verilog top.v<br>
#elaborate design hierarchy<br>
hierarchy -check -top top<br>
#mapping to internal cell library<br>
synth -top top<br>
#mapping flip-flops to mycells.lib<br>
#dfflibmap -liberty NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib<br>
#mapping logic to mycells.lib<br>
abc -liberty NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib<br>
#cleanup<br>
clean<br>
#write synthesized design<br>
write_verilog -noattr synth.v<br>

I got the following netlist -
